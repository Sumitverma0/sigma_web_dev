    <div><pre>IN some problem the Cascade Algorithm
        is used to resolve the problem of conflict
        1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear 
        2. Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
        3. Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
        4. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
        Lets look into all these one by one
        note:- Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector</pre></div>
